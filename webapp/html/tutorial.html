     <p class = "div"> Welcome to Healthy Henry, a text based role-playing game. You will take control of our main protagonist,
        Henry, and make decisions on behalf of him.
        These choices have consequences on Henry's health, money and time. 
        Your role as a player is to do the best you can to make sure Henry stays as healthy as possible, playing around certain constraints. 
        There are also certain factors and complexities which are pre-determined 
        such as distance to nearest supermarket, initial budget, environments, laws etc.
        You will have no control over these factors, as a way to show that Henry can end up having a bad health even if you make
        the best possible choices for him (depending on these conditions).
    </p>
