    <p>OTHER FACTORS:</p>
    <p>
    A correlation has been found between obesity and average wealth indicators in different regions.
    <br/>Genetics is another factor that plays a very important part in affecting obesity.
    <br/>A region's cultural background, location (determines availability), as well as the development of various localised marketing strategies also influence average obesity levels.
